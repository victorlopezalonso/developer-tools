## Update
This should be much easier to install now. Please follow the directions below.

### Directions
+ Download and install the original [Material Theme](http://equinusocio.github.io/material-theme/), first.
+ Download the zip of this project and rename the folder to `Jeffrey Way Theme`.
+ In Sublime, go to **Preferences > Browse Packages** and move the `Jeffrey Way Theme` folder to that location.
+ **Do not erase all your settings. Only change the following:** 
	- Go to **Preferences > Settings-User** and change `color_scheme` and `theme` to this: 

```json
"color_scheme": "Packages/Jeffrey Way Theme/schemes/Facebook.tmTheme",
"theme": "Material-Theme.sublime-theme",
```

You should be good from here. Let me know if issues arise.
